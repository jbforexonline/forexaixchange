# Wallet Management - Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ Wallet Operations with Real-Time Updates

### 1. **Deposit (MTN Mobile Money - Instant)**

**Flow**:
- User deposits via MTN/MoMo → **INSTANT** wallet update
- Other methods → Pending (requires admin approval)

**Real-Time Update**: ✅ Emitted via WebSocket `walletUpdated`

```typescript
// MTN deposits processed instantly
if (method === 'MTN' || method === 'MoMo') {
  wallet.available += amount; // Instant update
  emitWalletUpdate(userId); // Real-time notification
}
```

---

### 2. **Withdrawal (All Methods)**

**Flow**:
- User requests withdrawal → Funds **held instantly** (deducted from available)
- Admin approves → Funds permanently withdrawn (update totalWithdrawn)
- Admin rejects → Funds returned to available

**Real-Time Updates**:
- ✅ When withdrawal created: Balance updated (funds held)
- ✅ When approved: Balance updated (funds removed)
- ✅ When rejected: Balance updated (funds returned)

---

### 3. **Internal Transfers (Premium Only)**

**Flow**:
- Sender creates transfer → Funds **held instantly** (deducted from available)
- Admin approves → Funds moved to recipient
- Admin rejects → Funds returned to sender

**Real-Time Updates**:
- ✅ When transfer created: Sender balance updated (funds held)
- ✅ When approved: Both sender & recipient balances updated
- ✅ When rejected: Sender balance updated (funds returned)

**Email Contact**: ✅ Recipient email included in response for contact

---

### 4. **Bet Placement**

**Flow**:
- User places bet → Funds **deducted instantly** from available → moved to held
- Balance updates in real-time

**Calculation**:
```
Before bet: available = $100, held = $0
Place $10 bet: available = $90, held = $10
```

**Real-Time Update**: ✅ Emitted immediately via WebSocket

---

### 5. **Bet Settlement (Win/Loss)**

#### **WIN Scenario**:
```
Before settlement: available = $90, held = $10 (stake)
Win payout = $15 (stake $10 + profit $5)

After settlement:
  available = $90 + $15 = $105 ✅ (original balance + winnings)
  held = $10 - $10 = $0
  totalWon += $5 (profit only)
```

**Formula**: `New Balance = Original Balance + Profit`
- Stake was already deducted at bet time
- Winner gets: stake returned + profit added

#### **LOSS Scenario**:
```
Before settlement: available = $90, held = $10 (stake)
Loss: stake forfeited

After settlement:
  available = $90 (unchanged)
  held = $10 - $10 = $0 ✅ (stake removed, NO return)
  totalLost += $10
```

**Formula**: `New Balance = Original Balance` (stake lost, no return)

**Real-Time Updates**: ✅ Emitted for both winners and losers

## 📡 WebSocket Events

All wallet operations emit `walletUpdated` event to user's personal room:

```javascript
// Client receives
socket.on('walletUpdated', (data) => {
  data = {
    userId: string,
    available: number,    // Available balance
    held: number,         // Held funds
    total: number,        // Total (available + held)
    totalDeposited: number,
    totalWithdrawn: number,
    totalWon: number,
    totalLost: number,
    reason: 'deposit' | 'withdrawal' | 'bet_placed' | 'bet_won' | 'bet_lost' | 'transfer',
    // Context-specific fields:
    amount?: number,      // For deposits/withdrawals
    profitAmount?: number, // For wins
    payoutAmount?: number, // For wins
    lostAmount?: number,   // For losses
  }
});
```
