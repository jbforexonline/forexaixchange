## 🎯 Algorithm Compliance

The settlement algorithm in `rounds-settlement.service.ts` correctly implements:
- ✅ Minority rule: Winner = side with less USD
- ✅ Tie detection: `isTied()` checks if both sides are equal (including 0-0 case triggers Indecision)
- ✅ Indecision override: Any tie → Indecision wins, all layers lose
- ✅ Per-layer independent settlement when no ties
- ✅ Correct payout math: `payoutPerDollar = distributable / winnersPool`
- ✅ House fee: 2% of losers pool

**The algorithm matches algorithm.txt specification exactly.**
