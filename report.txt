DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
· Backend: Ready for deployment ✅
· Frontend: Can deploy with current features, missing power bars/leaderboards
· Minimum viable product: Add power bars + premium cancel → ~75% ready
· Full product: All Priority 1 + 2 items → ~90% ready

TESTING PRIORITIES:
· All spin logic scenarios (pairs, indecision, payouts) ✅
· Timer logic (demo vs live, freeze rules) ✅
· Premium vs free user features ✅
· WebSocket real-time updates ✅
· Wallet operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) ✅
· Power bars real-time updates (when implemented)
· Leaderboard calculations (when implemented)

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
· Backend stability: Production ready ✅
· Frontend integration: Core features working ✅
· Real-time updates: WebSocket functioning well ✅
· API response times: Acceptable ✅
· Missing: Frontend component completion

The backend remains production-ready. Frontend has made significant progress in core integrations. Power bars and leaderboards are the next critical features for launch readiness.
